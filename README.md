##### Introduction
------------------
*Rate Limiter* module can be useful when to disallow concurrent web service 
access to the application. 

##### Features
This module exposes a "Rate Limiting" service for RestAPI web service calls.
This service features:
* Define number of concurrent allowed hits in a given time window.
* Rate limiting on each request.
* Limit hits based on IP address.
* IP White listing option.
* Defines a separate cache bin to store the rate limiter hits and counts.
* Exportable configurations.
* Supports `Accept` HTTP headers and Drupal recommended `_format` calls. 

##### Requirements
------------------
* RESTful Web Services
* Serialization

##### Installation
------------------
Follow [installation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8) 
guide to install the module into the site.

##### Configuration
------------------
Navigate to Configuration >> Web services >> Rate Limiter Configuration 
(admin/config/services/rate-limiter).
The configuration has two segments.
* General Configuration
* Access Rules

**General Configuration** has basic configurations to enable the module with 
allowed request limit in an allowed time frame. 
An optional message can be shown when the limit is reached.

**Access Rules** has two option to enable rate limiting service for all 
web-service request or based on IP. 
If IP based rate limiting is selected then there is an IP based 
white listing option available.

##### Assumptions
------------------
The following points were assumed while developing the module.

1. Every Web-service call either have "Accept" header or "_format" query string.
2. The Rate Limiting service will only work on requests with 
"application/json", "application/xml" and "application/hal+json" `Accept` headers
or `_format` query string with "json", "hal_json" and "xml" values.
3. Command line requests and "text/html" requests are considered as normal
drupal requests to the site not as Service calls.

##### Caution
------------------
This module stores all it's rate limiter hit counts in Drupal's cache. 
So clearing cache will remove all the items. 
Assumed that in a production environment caches are not cleared more often.

##### Future Improvements
------------------
* Enable *Bearer Token* based Rate limiting service with [OAuth2 Server](https://www.drupal.org/project/oauth2_server) module.
* Based on Feature Requests more improvements.
* Integration test suite for testing Rate Limiting service.

##### Change Log
------------------
* 8.x-1.0 - Initial version created.
* 8.x-1.1 - Improvements over "Accept header based routing".
  * Based on [#2501221](https://www.drupal.org/node/2501221) now supports `_format` to determine a service request
    and Response.
